                <p>Food Tourism Experiences, also called culinary
                    experiences, incorporate more than just food
                    and drinks. Travellers want to learn about,
                    appreciate, and consume food and drink that
                    reflects our culture, heritage, and traditions.
                    They want a memorable experience that gives
                    them a <b>“taste of place”.</b></p>
                <p>Food can inspire travel by providing experiences
                    rooted in, and reflective of, our unique local
                    food culture. For the purposes of tourism
                    development, food in tourism focuses primarily
                    on tours, festivals and events, restaurants,
                    accommodations, and retailers.</p>
